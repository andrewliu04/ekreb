This project was created using Vite + React.

Completing this project was not just a challenge, but also a very enjoyable experience. It refreshed me on a lot of topics relating to the frontend and backend.
This was my first time using Vite + React, and it was a good experience as I was able to utilize their Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to speed up my development by retaining
the application state when reloading the app. I also learned some new RegEx syntax while completing my web app. If I had more time (less procrastination), 
I would have definitely loved to add more features and make the frontend prettier, although I liked the simplistic frontend that I created.
